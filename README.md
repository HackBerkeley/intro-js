# Hackers @ Berkeley: Intro to JavaScript

In this workshop, I'll be giving you an overview of JavaScript, the programming language, and how you can use JavaScript in the browser.

I won't be teaching HTML/CSS.

**Please go to http://github.com/HackBerkeley/intro-js and click "Download ZIP". Alternately, go to https://github.com/HackBerkeley/intro-js/archive/master.zip**. If you know how to use git, you can use that too.

## Prerequisites:

1. **You know how to code.** This workshop is not designed to teach you how to code. I'll be assuming CS 61A-level knowledge of Python.
2. Please make sure you have `Google Chrome`. Optional: also install `Node.js` [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). (If you can't get node.js installed, don't worry).
