# Hackers @ Berkeley: Intro to JavaScript

In this workshop, I'll be giving you an overview of JavaScript, the programming language, and how you can use JavaScript in the browser.

I won't be teaching HTML/CSS.

**Please go to http://github.com/HackBerkeley/intro-js and click "Download ZIP". Alternately, go to https://github.com/HackBerkeley/intro-js/archive/master.zip**. If you know how to use git, you can use that too.

Solutions are in `solutions`.

## Prerequisites:

2. Please make sure you have `Google Chrome`.

2. Exercises. Show people how to test the code in Chrome, and how to use debugger.
